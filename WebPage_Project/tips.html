                <h3>1. Install a Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware</h3>
                <p>
                    This tip is a bit obvious but most people never really install anti viruses in computers.Using this softwares is a good way to
                    keep your device virus free.Below I will leave a list of Anti viruses I recommend.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Keep your Anti-Virus up to date</h3>
                <p>
                    This other tip goes in hand with the first one. Keeping your anti virus up to date is a must. Most of the anti virus have updates
                    almost daily to keep your devices protected at all time. So make sure to check daily for updates in your device protecting software.

                <h3>3. Keep your operating system up to date</h3>
                <p>
                    Keeping your OS up to date is also a security measure people should take. Most computers now days update automatically but if for some
                    reason you don't have that feature on then make sure to scan for updates daily.

                <h3>4. Protect your Network</h3>
                <p>
                    Many PC connect with external devices such as Printers and other IOT devices using WIFI, make sure that your WIFI isn't public.
                    Use a WPA or WPA2 password encryption for your network. PME is no longer a secure method of encryption for wifi.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>5. Don't use unsecured WIFI</h3>
                <p>
                    Don’t use the free, open Wi-Fi (no password or encryption) in cafés, libraries, airports, etc.
                    Think about it. If you can connect easily, how far can a hacker go? If you think of using a unsecured Wi-Fi try using a VPN. A common and
                    good VPN would be Norton VPN since its constantly going through changes to benefit the user.
                </p>

                <h3>6. Scan your device regularly</h3>
                <p>
                    This might also go without saying, but we often forget to do it. Adjust the settings so scans run at regular intervals (like once a week).
                    Using the device while antivirus software is running can be challenging. Try running it at night when the computer is idle.
                    Because we usually turn our devices off at night, we tend to overlook scans.
                    Set the antivirus software to run on a specific night and only leave the computer on at that time.
                    Make sure it doesn’t switch off automatically or go into hibernation mode.
                </p>

                <h3>7. Think twice before clicking a suspicious link or item</h3>
                <p>
                    Avoid websites you don’t trust. Don’t open email attachments from people or companies you don’t know. Don’t click on links in unwanted emails.
                    Always hover the mouse over a link (especially a short URL) before clicking on it to see where it will take you. If you think the link is suspicious
                    or looks unsecure you can use: www.urlscan.io give it the link and wait for the results to see if its a malicious link or a link you can go to.

                <h3>8. Keep your personal information secure</h3>
                <p>
                    This is probably the hardest thing to do on the Internet.
                    Many hackers use social engineering over brute force to access your files.
                    They can gather enough information to hack your online accounts to collect even more data.
                </p>

                <p>
                    They go from account to account until they have all they need to get hold of your bank details and steal your identity.
                    Be careful on message boards and social media. Block all your privacy settings and avoid using your real name in chat forums.
                </p>

                <h3>9. Back up your files daily</h3>
                <p>
                    Backing up all your files is the best form of protection.
                    Ideally, keep your files in three places: where you work on them (your computer);
                    an external storage device; and somewhere else.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Use a back-up service or get two external hard drives and keep one at work; a relative or a friend’s house; or in a safe.
                </p>

                <h3>10. Always use Secured passwords</h3><!--Source for password managers = https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-password-managers?test_uuid=00yyZwi7Jhwj42oJG5A1uwg&test_variant=b-->
                <p>
                    Never use the same password twice, especially for bank accounts.
                    We usually use the same email address or username, which are easy to see and steal.
                    If you always use the same password and someone uncovers it, it’ll take just a few seconds to hack into all your accounts.
                    Choose a strong password with lower- and upper-case letters, numbers and symbols.
                    Make it easy to remember but difficult to predict. Don’t use dates or pets’ names. If you don't know how to create a strong password try using a
                    password manager to help you create passwords.Here are some password managers you could use:
